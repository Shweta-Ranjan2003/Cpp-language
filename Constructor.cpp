/*
A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class.
The constructor doesnâ€™t have a return type. Constructors are used to initialize the objects of its class.
Constructors are automatically invoked whenever an object is created.
Important Characteristics of Constructors in C++

A constructor should be declared in the public section of the class
They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created
They cannot return values and do not have return types
It can have default arguments
We cannot refer to their address

/*
Constructor overloading is a concept in which one class can have multiple constructors with different parameters.
The main thing to note here is that the constructors will run according to the arguments 
for example if a program consists of 3 constructors with 0, 1, and 2 arguments, so if we pass 1 argument 
to the constructor the compiler will automatically run the constructor which is taking 1 argument.
