/*
Object oriented programming:- works on the concept of classes and objects. A class is a template to create 
objects . Treats data as a critical elements . Decomposes the problems in objects and builds data and functions
around the objects.

Classes - Basic template for creating objects
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members(data variables) and
member functions( functions used to manipulate these variables).A class is like a blueprint for an object
Eg. class-cars and  wheels, speed limits, mileage are their data members and member functions
 can apply brakes, increase speed etc.

Objects – Basic run-time entities
An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour.
 An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when
it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data. 

Data Abstraction :- Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.

Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms eg:- operator overloading , function overloading etc.

Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is decided at runtime.

Message Passing – message (Information) call format.  A message for an object is a request for execution of
a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results.
